# Regularization ðŸš€

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with **easy-to-revise notes** on the three major regularization techniques in machine learning:

- **Ridge Regression (L2)** â€“ Shrinks coefficients but doesnâ€™t remove features.
- **Lasso Regression (L1)** â€“ Performs feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero.
- **Elastic Net** â€“ Combines Ridge and Lasso for balanced performance.

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside
- **Detailed revision notes** â€“ Clear explanations, formulas, and when to use each method.
- **Interview memory hooks** â€“ Mnemonics and quick triggers for recalling concepts under pressure.
- **Python examples** â€“ Ready-to-run sklearn code snippets.

## ðŸ›  How to Use
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/regularization-cheatsheet.git
   cd regularization-cheatsheet
